#Intranet Project 1
This project contains several plotting scripts that visualize different datasets using matplotlib and numpy. Each script demonstrates a different type of graph, including stacked bar charts, scatter plots, line plots, and histograms.

Plots Overview:
Stacked Bar Plot - Fruit per Person

Visualizes the number of apples, bananas, oranges, and peaches that three individuals (Farrah, Fred, Felicia) possess.
Each type of fruit is represented by a unique color, and the bars are stacked for each person.
The y-axis shows the total quantity of fruit.
Scatter Plot - Men's Height vs Weight

A scatter plot representing the correlation between men's height (x-axis) and weight (y-axis) with randomly generated data points.
The plot uses magenta points to show the data distribution.
Line Plot - Exponential Decay of Carbon-14

Shows the decay of Carbon-14 over time using a logarithmic y-axis.
The x-axis represents time in years, and the y-axis represents the fraction of Carbon-14 remaining.
Line Plot - Exponential Decay of C-14 and Ra-226

Compares the exponential decay of Carbon-14 and Ra-226 over time.
The plot uses dashed red lines for C-14 and solid green lines for Ra-226, with a legend to distinguish between the two.
Histogram - Student Grades

A histogram displaying the distribution of grades for a group of students.
The x-axis shows grade ranges (0-100), and the y-axis shows the number of students in each range.
Requirements:
numpy
matplotlib
