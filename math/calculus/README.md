Calculus Project
Overview: This project provides a Python tool for performing symbolic calculus operations using the SymPy library. The project supports:

Sigma Notation (Summation)
Differentiation (Derivatives)
Integration (Definite and Indefinite Integrals)

Features
Sigma Notation: Perform summation operations using symbolic or numeric limits.
Differentiation: Calculate derivatives of functions with respect to variables.
Integration: Compute both definite and indefinite integrals.
Supports a variety of functions, including polynomials, trigonometric, exponential, and more.

Future Enhancements
Higher-order derivatives and sums.
Multi-variable calculus (e.g., partial derivatives and multiple integrals).
