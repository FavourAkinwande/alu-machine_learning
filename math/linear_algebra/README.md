**Linear Algebra Project**

This project focuses on implementing and understanding core concepts of Linear Algebra using Python and NumPy. It includes practical applications such as matrix operations, solving linear systems, vector spaces, and transformations.

The goal of the project is to demonstrate how fundamental linear algebra operations can be applied to real-world problems using Python, making abstract mathematical concepts more tangible and interactive.

Features
Matrix Operations: Addition, multiplication, transposition, and inversion.
Determinants : Compute the determinant of matrices.
Solving Linear Systems: Use matrix methods to solve systems of linear equations.
Linear Transformations: Apply linear transformations to vectors and visualize them.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for implementing the algorithms.
NumPy: Library used for numerical computations, matrix manipulations, and linear algebra operations.
